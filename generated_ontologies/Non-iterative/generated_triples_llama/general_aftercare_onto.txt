The provided code is already in Turtle format, so you don't need to write any code to generate the RDF triples. The code provided is the correct output. However, if you want to generate this output programmatically, you would need to use a programming language such as Python or Java to connect to the SQL database, query the table, and then use a library such as rdflib to generate the RDF triples in Turtle format. 

Here is an example of how you might do this in Python:
```python
import sqlite3
from rdflib import Graph

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query the table
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM general_aftercare')

# Get the column names
column_names = [description[0] for description in cursor.description]

# Create a new RDF graph
g = Graph()

# Loop over the rows
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    # Loop over the columns
    for i, value in enumerate(row):
        # Map the column name to the ontology term
        if column_names[i] == 'id':
            term = ':PatientID'
        elif column_names[i] == 'patient_id':
            term = ':PatientID'
        elif column_names[i] == 'created_at':
            term = ':Timestamp'
        elif column_names[i] == 'date_of_aftercare':
            term = ':Date'
        elif column_names[i] == 'height_cm':
            term = ':Length'
        elif column_names[i] == 'weight_kg':
            term = ':Weight'
        elif column_names[i] == 'bmi':
            term = ':Weight'
        elif column_names[i] == 'incisional_hernia':
            term = ':Boolean'
        elif column_names[i] == 'incisional_hernia_surgery':
            term = ':Boolean'
        elif column_names[i] == 'gall_bladder_leakage':
            term = ':Boolean'
        elif column_names[i] =='supply_of_the_leakage':
            term = ':String'
        elif column_names[i] == 'bile_duct_stenosis':
            term = ':Boolean'
        elif column_names[i] == 'treatment_of_stenosis':
            term = ':String'
        elif column_names[i] =='rez_cholangitis':
            term = ':Boolean'
        elif column_names[i] == 'aftercare_text':
            term = ':String'
        elif column_names[i] == 'oesophageal_stenosis':
            term = ':Boolean'

        # Add the RDF triple to the graph
        g.add((general_aftercare + column_names[i], RDF.type, term))

# Print the RDF graph in Turtle format
print(g.serialize(format='turtle'))
```
Note that this is just an example and you will need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to install the rdflib library and import it in your code. 

Also, note that the above code assumes that the SQL table has the exact same column names as the ones provided in the ontology. If the column names are different, you will need to modify the code to map the column names to the ontology terms correctly. 

Finally, note that this code generates the RDF triples in Turtle format, but it does not include any additional information such as the ontology version or the license. If you need to include this information, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
