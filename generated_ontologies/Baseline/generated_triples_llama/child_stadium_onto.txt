```sql
SELECT 
  child_stadium_id AS?childStadiumId,
  child_stadium_definition AS?childStadiumDefinition
FROM 
  child_stadium;
```

## Step 1: Identify the columns from the SQL query as RDF triples
The SQL query selects two columns: child_stadium_id and child_stadium_definition. These will be used as the subjects and objects of the RDF triples.

## Step 2: Determine the predicates based on the ontology
The provided ontology is not explicitly stated, but based on common practices in mapping relational databases to RDF, we can infer that the predicates will be:
-?childStadiumId: a property that represents the identifier of a child stadium, likely an rdfs:label or an skos:prefLabel.
-?childStadiumDefinition: a property that represents the definition of a child stadium, likely a rdfs:comment or a skos:definition.

## Step 3: Generate the RDF triples in Turtle format
Based on the columns and predicates identified, we can generate the RDF triples as follows:
- <child_stadium_id> a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource>.
- <child_stadium_id> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>?childStadiumId.
- <child_stadium_id> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment>?childStadiumDefinition.
- <child_stadium_id> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "child_stadium_id".
- <child_stadium_id> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "child_stadium_definition".
- <child_stadium_id> <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer>?childStadiumId.

## Step 4: Simplify the RDF triples by removing unnecessary statements
Since we are only interested in the mapping of the SQL table and its columns to the provided ontology, we can remove the unnecessary statements.

## Step 5: Format the RDF triples in Turtle format
The final RDF triples in Turtle format are:
- <child_stadium_id> a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource>.
- <child_stadium_id> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/r
