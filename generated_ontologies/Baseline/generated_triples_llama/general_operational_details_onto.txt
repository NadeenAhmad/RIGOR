Please note that the 'general_operational_details' table is used as a source for the ontology mapping.

# For each column in the table, create a triple of the form:
# <table_name> <column_name> <value>
# For example, given a row with id = 1, patient_id = 2, created_at = '2020-01-01', op_date = '2020-01-01', surgeon = 'Dr. Smith', etc.
# the triples would be:
# general_operational_details id 1
# general_operational_details patient_id 2
# general_operational_details created_at 2020-01-01
# general_operational_details op_date 2020-01-01
# general_operational_details surgeon Dr. Smith
# etc.

# Also, note that we are assuming that the 'value' of each column is a literal and not a resource.
